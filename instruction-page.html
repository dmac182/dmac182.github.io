								<h2>Some Context</h2>
									<div class="describe-body">
									<p>I was personally selected by a professor of an upper division writing course in the School of Interactive Art and Entertainment at Simon Fraser University to be a research assistant. I was tasked with assisting in the planning, creation and refinement of an instructional video to help students plan their persuasive writing papers.</p>

								<h3>My Process.</h3>
									<div class="describe-body">
									<p>Work for the video initial began through story boarding. This process entailed discussing ideas between myself and another research assistant. Deciding on transition effects, and which visuals would best communicate the learning objectives of the video. This process proved to be an efficient method in developing ideas and concepts for the video to discuss while outline which may be ineffective.</p>

								<h3>Audio Editing.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>After the video was planned I assisted in the writing of the final script for the video which I then recorded and edited. The voice over for the video was recorded with Audacity, which was also used to edit out breaths, background noise and to reduce the tempo as the initial recording was too quickly spoken.</p>

								<h3>Video Editing.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>The entire video editing process was divided between myself and another research assistant. Keyframe animation was used throughout the video to match visual elements to the voice over audio and to use visually interesting transitions to keep the attention of students. Subtitles were created as a text layer, synced with the voice over. The video went through several iterations following student feedback and iterated to its current state.</p>
