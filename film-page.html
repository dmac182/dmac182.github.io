								<h2>Some Context</h2>
									<div class="describe-body">
									<p>This short narrative movie was created for an upper division film course. As a group of four, my team and I were required to specialize into different roles in order to complete this project over the course of six weeks. We were challenged to create a complete narrative story arc in 5 minutes that was non-traditional.</p>

								<h3>My Process.</h3>
									<div class="long-description">
									<p>The core narrative of the film changed drastically over the course of three weeks, due to the entire team being unable to settle on an idea to base the narrative around. To resolve this, both myself and another writer decided on a simpler narrative arc to define a new concept for the story. This required focusing the story around a single concept (in this case a dying man) and creating an entire story arc that could resolve in the context of a five minute short film.</p>

								<h3>Directing.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>During filming I served as a Director, calling action and cut as well as providing direction to our film's actors. Initially, this experience was overwhelming as I had to quickly adapt to providing instructions to our actors regarding their performances, this required clear and explicit in my instructions to avoid misunderstandings to get the shots we needed. Being one of the writers I was able to envision how I wanted the story to be told. This also helped me to direct our primary actors and communicate how I wanted them to portray the characters of our narrative. My experience as a director helped me learn to be a more efficient communicator in addition to being able to see a vision through from conception to completion.</p>

								<h3>Visual Effects Editing.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>Outside of writing and filming I also served as one of the primary special effects editors. Particularly, I edited the opening title and credits sequence. This involved implementing transitions, creating particle effects and syncing them with transforming typography. One particular challenge from this role was syncing multiple special effects to occur simultaneously, which requires sequential timing of several effects. While the film as a whole did not use many special effects, the particle system I implemented in the opening sequence is also used throughout the narrative during the dream sequences.</p>
