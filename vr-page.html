								<h2>Some Context</h2>
									<div class="describe-body">
									<p>This project was completed as a team of three over the course of three weeks for an upper division immersive environment course. The project was developed in Unity and made use of the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset. We were tasked to create a project that “goes beyond” a traditional VR experience.</p>

								<h3>My Process.</h3>
									<div class="long-description">
									<p>The concept behind this project titled Forlorn, changed radically over the course of its development. From an initial affinity diagramming session, I had suggested to create an experience using a boat to work with limitations of the Oculus Rift. As a team we planned around a digital experience which would not require the user to walk but they could play while sitting in a boat. From there we planned the setup of the physical installation to enhance this experience we envisioned.</p>

								<h3>Writing.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>My role as writer involved me writing three distinct scenarios to explore. After deciding as a group on one of these concepts, I wrote the script, which involved outlining the narrative setting and different character motivations. The intended user experience of the project was to evoke helplessness and isolation in the user while allowing them to freely explore a 3D environment and experience the narrative at their own pace. I was also responsible for creating various media materials such as the executive summary and project poster.</p>

								<h3>Voice Over.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>Upon completing the script I was charged with finding voice actors, recording their lines with them and editing the recorded audio. This process involved eliminating background noise, editing lines together and adding effects. I also performed as one of the characters and provided the voice over track for the project summary video. This responsibility also carried over to setting up and recording interviews with users at a public demonstration of the project.</p>

								<h3>Video Editing.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>Outside of my contributions as a writer, voice actor and designer in the initial planning and conception of the project I also assisted with the refinement and editing of the video summary of the project. This required editing timed keyframe animations, syncing audio and video content as well as creating visual assets to be used within the video. The summary video went through a few iterations before being shown live in front of class of my peers.</p>
