								<h2>Some Context</h2>
									<div class="describe-body">
									<p>This project was completed as a team of three over the course of six weeks for an upper division speculative design course. The project serves as a conceptual prototype based on my teamâ€™s proposed design using a design fiction approach. This video was entirely made by us including all assets used and creating in Adobe After Effects. We were challenged to propose a design that would challenge and critique potential future and current design trends.</p>

								<h3>My Process.</h3>
									<div class="long-description">
									<p>This project first began by learning different speculative design approaches and frameworks. Then as a group we were tasked with coming up with a design that made use of a chosen framework which was in this case, was design fiction. Afterwards myself and my two teammates proposed several design concepts using this approach which took the form of a design workbook. Upon receiving feedback from the course instructors we decided to select one of these concepts and design a video prototype to showcase our design. This involved planning, directing and editing a video of this concept.</p>

								<h3>Speculate.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>As both a speculative designer and writer I was responsible for outline storyboard events which were later drawn by another teammate. Our project set out to explore. This video required making use of first person camera shots to communicate our design, which presented a challenge in filming first person scenes with a glide camera setup. One of the challenges was in planning time in each scene for the visual effects, ensuring dialogue and cutting would have enough time. This process also involved mastering audio by recording voice lines with our actors in post production.</p>

								<h3>Motion Graphics.</h3>
								<div class="long-description">
									<p>My other primary contributions to this project were as an effects editor. To establish our concept as a prototype I had to create and time intensive keyframed animation and motion graphics. I was given a rough cut of the video and then compiled the visual effects onto each scene. This approach was challenging in that the visual effects were strictly constrained to the timing and length of edited footage. I had to create several iterations of the effects in order to get the timing right which was time consuming and had to be done for each different scene. However, from this experience I have learned a better workflow process in collaboration between edited video footage and motion effects. Although I were to do this again I would create the motion graphics first, to have their timing planned then plan and shoot the video based on that timing for more efficient collaboration and workflow.</p>
